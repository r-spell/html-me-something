            I have been stenciling since I was in high school (so about 15 years).
            Most of that time I was doing stencils, by hand, with contact paper and x-acto knives.
            My earliest works were generally just black and white and were based on hand-drawn images or images altered with <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP.</a> 
            Over the years I have done more with multicolor prints with stencils. I use GIMP and <a href="https://inkscape.org/"> Inkscape </a> 
            to help me design stencils which make up different color layers to create a multicolor print. In the past year, I have also started using a laser cutter to make stencils. I belong to <a href="https://archreactor.org"> Arch Reactor, </a> a community space for makers, which has a laser cutter members can use.
